The Interactive E-Learning Platform is a responsive and user-friendly web application designed to enhance online learning experiences. Built using HTML, Tailwind CSS, and JavaScript, it provides an intuitive interface where users can browse available courses, watch embedded instructional videos, and track their learning progress. The platform features a progress tracking system, allowing users to mark courses as completed, with their progress visually represented through a dynamic progress bar. This data is stored in local storage, ensuring that progress remains intact even after refreshing or revisiting the page.

To improve user engagement, the platform includes collapsible course sections, which keep the interface clean and organized. Users can expand or hide course content with a simple click, making navigation more seamless. Additionally, the dark mode toggle enables users to switch between light and dark themes, with their preferences saved for future visits. Interactive elements such as animated buttons and smooth UI transitions further enhance the learning experience.

Looking ahead, this platform has the potential for future enhancements, including user authentication for cross-device progress syncing, quiz integration to assess learning outcomes, and backend support to manage course data more effectively. With its clean design, interactive features, and real-time progress tracking, this project provides an engaging and accessible e-learning solution for learners of all levels.
